# Deep-Learning-Algorithms-on-EMNIST-handwritten-character-dataset

This code implements three deep learning models—Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—to classify handwritten 
characters using the EMNIST handwritten character dataset. The Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) model achieves the highest training accuracy compared to Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) model and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Preprocessing steps like flipping and 
rotation were applied on the dataset to correct image orientation and hyperparameter tuning of 
all the three models were implemented to generate the best parameters. The methodology, 
strengths and weaknesses of each model were discussed, highlighting their applicability and 
performance trade-offs.
